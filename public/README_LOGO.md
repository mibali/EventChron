# DualMind Logo Setup

To add your DualMind logo:

1. Place your logo file at: `/public/dualmind-logo.png`
2. Recommended size: 32x32px or 64x64px (it will be displayed at 16x16px in the footer)
3. The footer will automatically use your logo once the file is in place

If you have a larger logo file, you can resize it using:
- Online tools like https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image
- Image editing software
- Or the app will automatically compress it when uploaded
